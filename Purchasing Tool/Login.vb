' Module: Variables.vb
'
' Description: Contains all of the common variables that are used in the entire project more than once as well as some debugging tools.
'
' Variable Discriptions:
'	_cn = This is the ODBC Connection that we use to access the Quickbooks database. It uses the active Quickbooks connection to preform
'		the ODBC queries. These queries are used to check if there has been an update to any of the items and gets item information and 
'		build assemblies for importing.

' Module: Login.vb
'
' Description: This is the opening window of the program. The user must have a valid user name and password to log in.
'
' Special Keys:
'   enter = enters the user name and password and trys to log the user in.
